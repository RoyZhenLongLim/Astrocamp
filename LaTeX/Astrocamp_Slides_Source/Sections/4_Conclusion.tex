Research Advice:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start your report early and do it as you go (keep track of your sources add to your bibliograph periodically)
    \item Schedule time so you can focus on the research (you will most definitely have a few days - few weeks where you have no idea what you are doing) (the hardest part is starting)
\end{itemize}
