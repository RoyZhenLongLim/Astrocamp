\section{Misc}

% This section is a placeholder for you to go over crucial points to takeaway from your presentation.
In summary, during this project, I have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crashed my computer 3 times when trying to open up an 18GB file
    \item Written more than 1000 lines of code
    \item 983701 characters in total for meeting minutes and code + other research (if my git command works like I think it does)
\end{itemize}

Also an FYI, we have a lot of spare tongs in the Research Student room on Floor 1 if you would like them owo.
