# Python
## Getting Started
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - P.S. Log out and logging back in generally does the trick for anything you might need to restart your computer for
  - FYI: If you need to restart your computer, most of the time logging out and logging back in does the trick
  - Here are some python libraries to install:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - astropy
    - matplotlib
    - gala
2. Download and open the sample Juyper Notebook `intro.ipynb`
Optional:
- Depending on your project, you will use different library
- See `astropy.ipynb` or `lightkurve.ipynb` for more specialised introduction

## Appendix
If you have done programming with Python before/want to learn more on your own here are some recommendations.

### Configure your own IDE
- Personal IDE of Choice: [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)
  - If you register using UNSW email, you get it for free
  - Has a ton of features that may be more useful to you
 [Datalore](https://www.jetbrains.com/datalore/) is useful if you need more computing power
 
### Learn Git
[Git](https://github.com/git-guides) is the industry standard for coding. 
Learn in your spare time

### Python Packages
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (very pretty data visualisation)
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (Machine Learning)
- [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) (general scientific computing)

### Learn VIM Keybindings
Makes typing LaTeX much faster
