# Python
## Getting Started
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - P.S. Log out and logging back in generally does the trick for anything you might need to restart your computer for
  - FYI: If you need to restart your computer, most of the time logging out and logging back in does the trick
  - Here are some python libraries to install:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - astropy
    - gala
  - Alternatively, you can learn using with Juypter Notebooks online using [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Download and open the sample Juyper Notebook `intro.ipynb`
- `intro.ipynb` will give you are run down on:
  - Running Juypter Notebooks
  - Using Markdown to annotate your code
  - Python
  - Pandas (general purpose data science package) and Matploblib (general purpose plotting)
- Depending on your project, you will use different library
- For students with Sarah Martell, see `astropy.ipynb` for an introduction in astropy and Gala
- For students with Ben Montet, see `lightkurve.ipynb` for an introduction in lightkurve.

## Cheatsheets

## Appendix
If you have done programming with Python before/want to learn more on your own here are some recommendations.

### Configure your own IDE
- Personal IDE of Choice: [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)
  - If you register using UNSW email, you get it for free
  - Has a ton of features that may be more useful to you
 [Datalore](https://www.jetbrains.com/datalore/) is useful if you need more computing power
 
### Learn Git
[Git](https://github.com/git-guides) is the industry standard for coding. 
Learn in your spare time

### Python Packages
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (very pretty data visualisation)
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (Machine Learning)
- [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) (general scientific computing)

### Learn VIM Keybindings
Makes typing LaTeX much faster
