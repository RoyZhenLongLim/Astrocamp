# Python
## Getting Started
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - P.S. Log out and logging back in generally does the trick for anything you might need to restart your computer for
2. Download and open the sample Juyper Notebook `demo.ipynb`
